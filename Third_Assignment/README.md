# Third Assignment: Energy-Delay-Area Product Optimization (gem5 + McPAT)

## Step 1: Introduction to McPAT

### 1. Dynamic Power - Leakage Power

In general, leakage power is the power demand of an idle system, while dynamic power is the power demand that fluctuates depending on the load.

In a CPU, dynamic power is caused by logic gates changing state, while leakage power is caused by transistor leakage current and happens even when no change of state is necessary.

Dynamic power depends on the characteristics of the program executed. Certain CPU modules/instructions may consume more power than others. Leakage current is constant.

Since we are talking about power, the execution time of a program doesn't directly affect these two metrics (assuming that the program's resource demands stay constant)
